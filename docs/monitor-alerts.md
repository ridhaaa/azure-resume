## üîç Monitoring and Alerts

Monitoring is implemented to track resource activity, error patterns, and security events for the Cloud Resume project.

### ‚úÖ Diagnostic Settings for Storage Account

Azure Blob Storage was configured with **Diagnostic Settings** to forward logs to **Log Analytics Workspace**:

- **Logs Enabled**:
  - `StorageRead`, `StorageWrite`, `StorageDelete`
  - `StorageBlobLogs`
- **Destination**: Default Log Analytics workspace (auto-created by Azure)

### üìä Log Analytics Query for Failed Uploads

To monitor failed upload/download operations (e.g., permission-denied uploads):

```kusto
StorageBlobLogs
| where toint(StatusCode) >= 400
| summarize FailedRequests=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
```

The Logic App was manually configured from the Azure portal using the blank logic app designer with HTTP trigger and email connector.

### üß™ Testing Alerts

The alert was tested by simulating an unauthorized upload (RBAC-denied user). It triggered successfully and email was received from Logic App.

### üîê Access Control Testing (RBAC)

To ensure only specific roles can write to Blob Storage:
- A test user was created in Azure AD.
- Blob Contributor role was removed.
- Upload attempts by this user resulted in alerts and failed logs.
- Validated the alerting pipeline end-to-end.

### üìà Metrics Monitoring

Azure Metrics Explorer was used to visualize:

This helped validate when the blob operations were active and correlate with error logs.
